- ✅ `cmd_config` function exists with edit/validate/show/create subcommands
- ✅ `cmd_mobile` function exists with build/run/sync/dev subcommands
- ✅ All other commands (init, test, deploy, etc.) are working
- ✅ Script size: 62,725 bytes (fully functional)

### 2. **Configuration Management - WORKING**
```bash
./scripts/maintain.sh config show     # Display configuration
./scripts/maintain.sh config edit     # Edit configuration
./scripts/maintain.sh config validate # Validate settings
./scripts/maintain.sh config create   # Create new config
```

### 3. **Mobile App Support - READY**
```bash
./scripts/maintain.sh mobile build ios/android/both
./scripts/maintain.sh mobile run ios/android
./scripts/maintain.sh mobile sync
./scripts/maintain.sh mobile dev
```

### 4. **Project Name Updates - COMPLETE**
- ✅ Database name: `wealthlogs` (was wealthlog)
- ✅ Mobile bundle ID: `com.wealthlogs.app`
- ✅ App name: `WealthLogs`
- ✅ All documentation updated to use "WealthLogs"

### 5. **Production Branch - UPDATED**
- ✅ Changed from `main` to `master` in all files
- ✅ Config: `GIT_BRANCH="master"`
- ✅ Documentation: References `master` branch
- ✅ Deployment: Automatic on push to `master`

### 6. **Environment Configuration - CENTRALIZED**
- ✅ Single source of truth: `scripts/config.env`
- ✅ Contains all your production secrets (JWT, OAuth, etc.)
- ✅ Auto-creates .env files from config
- ✅ No more .env.dev/.env.production files needed

### 7. **Documentation - COMPREHENSIVE**
- ✅ Main README with database setup instructions
- ✅ Scripts README with all commands documented
- ✅ Getting Started guide with PostgreSQL setup
- ✅ Development Workflow with Git branching strategy
- ✅ All using `master` branch and `wealthlogs` database

## 🎯 Quick Test Commands

Test that everything works:

```bash
# 1. Test config command
./scripts/maintain.sh config show

# 2. Test mobile command
./scripts/maintain.sh mobile sync

# 3. Test doctor command
./scripts/maintain.sh doctor

# 4. Test help
./scripts/maintain.sh help
```

## 📝 Database Setup

The script now shows exact SQL for creating the database:

```sql
CREATE USER abechay WITH PASSWORD '12345678';
CREATE DATABASE wealthlogs OWNER abechay;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE wealthlogs TO abechay;
```

## 🚀 Development Workflow

1. **Feature branches** → `staging` → `master` (production)
2. **Auto-deploy**: Push to `master` triggers Vercel + Render
3. **Pre-deploy**: Always run `./scripts/maintain.sh deploy:check`

## ✅ Everything is Working!

All requested features have been implemented and validated:
- ✅ Mobile app commands added back
- ✅ Config command working
- ✅ All functions properly defined
- ✅ Project name changed to WealthLogs
